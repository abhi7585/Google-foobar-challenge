# Google-foobar-challenge

It was quite a buzz around regarding Google's foobar challenge. I too participated and solved 2 problems as of now. The questions were really interesting and I really enjoyed coding. Here is my solution to those two problems. You can read the questions in the readme.md file and can try by yourself.

Happy Coding !!!
